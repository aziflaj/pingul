# PinguL

PinguL (short for Pingu Language) is a programming language that I'm creating for fun.

It's a work in progress and I'm not sure what it will look like in the end. For now, I'm just trying to make it work.
It should look like a mix of Python and JavaScript, sorta like this:

```js
var age = 28;
var timeGoesBy = func(currentAge, yearsPassed) {
	return currentAge + yearsPassed;
};

var newAge = timeGoesBy(age, 1);
if (age < newAge) {
	return (1 == 1);
} else {
	return (1 != 1);
}

var truthness = (age <= newAge) and (2 >= 1);
var falseness = (age > newAge) or (2 < 1);

var amIAlive = true and not false;
```
